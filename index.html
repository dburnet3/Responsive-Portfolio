                <p><b>Hobbies:</b> Indulging in Bravo tv shows! She also enjoys
                    cooking and reading cookbooks.
                    <b>Favorite Foods:</b> Macaroni and Cheese, any salad from Sweet Green, and neapolitan ice cream!
                    <b>First thing she does in the morning:</b> Takes a breath, because most days might be challenging
                    but if she's reminded that every step she takes from that point on is just as intentional as taking
                    a breath
                    she can confidently conquer anything!</p>

                <p><b>Favorite US City:</b> Atlanta, GA
                    <b>Favorite Concert:</b> Brian McKnight. Denise wishes that she were born in the late
                    80's
                    so that she could have experienced the 90's like her older sister!</p>
                <p><b>Professional Background:</b> With 5 years of project management experience Denise has lead
                    software
                    development projects ranging from $120k - $2M
                    using Waterfall and Agile Methodologies. Her experience in both the public and private sectors has
                    equipped her to support
                    larger programs in various organizational structures.
                    <b>Education:</b> Spelman College (BS) & Kennesaw State University (MS)</p>
